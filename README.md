# Study-on-anomalous-stock-behaviour

Time series anomalies can provide light on crucial circumstances that have an impact on a company's stock. However, the scarcity of datasets and the intricate temporal relationships make it particularly difficult to identify the root of anomalies in time series data. The communication network has changed as a result of the recent advancements in internet technology, which have made it possible for users to share information like news, social media posts, and other content online. This has caused the amount of web data to rise rapidly. The solution to revealing the mysterious abnormal behaviour of the financial market may lie in the vast amounts of publicly available data. This study examines how anomalies in stock market series data can be found, and it also examines the relationships between sentiments expressed in news, tweets, and opinions and stock price, finding that these relationships are inversely correlated with stock price. Additionally, we suggest a lexicon-based approach that is enhanced for a financial dataset to uncover the driving forces behind an abnormal period.
